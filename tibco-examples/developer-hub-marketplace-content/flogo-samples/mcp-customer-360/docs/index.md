## Overview

This sample demonstrates how to use **TIBCO Flogo¬Æ Connector for Model Context Protocol (MCP)
Developer Preview** to expose **Customer 360 data** ‚Äî including **customers**, **products**, and **sales** ‚Äî using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. Once deployed, the Flogo MCP Server acts as an intelligent data orchestrator, enabling **AI agents** to query the data using **natural language (NLP)** without requiring any manual orchestration logic from the user.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- üß© **Expose business data as MCP tools**  
  Provides access to customer, product, and sales data

- ü§ñ **NLP-ready interface for AI agents**  
  Seamless integration with AI Agents like Claude Desktop or GitHub Copilot in VS Code to issue natural language queries

- üîÅ **Automatic orchestration**  
  No need to write or manage orchestration logic ‚Äî **Flogo MCP Server** handles it for you

- üóÉÔ∏è **Prebuilt sample datasets**  
  Includes mock data for sales, customer profiles, and product purchases

- üìä **Supports business-centric queries**, like:
    - _"Show me sales for Q1 2025"_
    - _"List customer names who have purchased more than 2 products and their details"_

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- TIBCO Flogo¬Æ Extension for Visual Studio Code 1.3.2 and above
- Any AI agent client capable of interacting with MCP Servers like Claude Desktop, GitHub Copilot etc


## Import the sample apps in the Workspace
Import CustProdSaleAPI.flogo, Customer360MCPServer.flogo apps in VS Code.

## Understanding the configuration
- CustProdSaleAPI.flogo app is a REST API server which will return dummy customers, products, sales data.
- Customer360MCPServer.flogo app is a FLOGO MCP server app which will expose these customers, products, sales data as MCP server tools to AI Agents.

## Run the application
- Run CustProdSaleAPI.flogo app from VsCode which will start the API server and you can access these endpoints - http://localhost:18080/products, http://localhost:18080/customers, http://localhost:18080/sales
- Make sure to check and update the app property CustInvokeRESTServiceURL, ProdInvokeRESTServiceURL, SaleInvokeRESTServiceURL in Customer360MCPServer app to point to url where your CustProdSaleAPI flogo app is running.
- Run Customer360MCPServer.flogo app from VsCode which will start FLOGO MCP Server at http://localhost:9091/mcp.
- You can configure this MCP Server url with Claude Desktop or GitHub Copilot in VS Code and send querries in natural language and get the response as shown below.
- You can send a query like "Show me sales for Q1 2025" or "List customer names who have purchased more than 2 products and their details" and you will get the result in AI Agent as shown below.
- As you can see, you dont need to write any specific business logic to query data which spans across different tools like customer, product, sales

> **Note:** In order to run the query in Claude Desktop, you will need to configure MCP Server url in > claude_desktop_config.json like below -

```
 {
  "mcpServers": {
    "FLOGO:CustomerProductSalesData": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "http://localhost:9091/mcp"]
    }
  }
 }
```

> You would also need to install npm and mcp-remote package in order for Claude Desktop to connect to MCP server.
