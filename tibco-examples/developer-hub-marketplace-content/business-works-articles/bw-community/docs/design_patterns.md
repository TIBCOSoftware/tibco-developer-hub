### Design Patterns Articles

#### Control Flows
**Summary:** Implement flow control patterns including throttling, circuit breakers, and backpressure mechanisms.  
**Tags:** `BW5X`, `BW6X`, `BWCE`, `flow-control`, `patterns`, `throttling`

**Description:**  
This comprehensive design pattern guide explores various flow control mechanisms essential for building resilient BusinessWorks applications. You'll learn how to implement throttling to prevent system overload, circuit breakers to handle service failures gracefully, backpressure mechanisms to manage queue buildup, and rate limiting to comply with SLA requirements. The article provides detailed implementation examples for each pattern, explaining when and how to apply them effectively.

Advanced flow control topics include implementing adaptive throttling based on system metrics, cascading circuit breakers in microservice architectures, managing flow control across distributed systems, and coordinating backpressure across multiple components. The guide addresses monitoring flow control effectiveness, tuning control parameters dynamically, handling flow control in event-driven architectures, and strategies for graceful degradation. Best practices cover testing flow control mechanisms, documenting flow control policies, preventing flow control from becoming a bottleneck, and balancing system protection with throughput requirements.

#### Implement Retry Mechanism
**Summary:** Build robust retry logic with exponential backoff, maximum attempts, and error classification.  
**Tags:** `BW6X`, `BWCE`, `retry`, `error-handling`, `resilience`

**Description:**  
This pattern guide provides comprehensive strategies for implementing sophisticated retry mechanisms in BusinessWorks applications, essential for handling transient failures and improving system resilience. You'll learn how to implement exponential backoff algorithms, classify errors as retryable or non-retryable, manage retry state across process instances, and implement circuit breakers to prevent retry storms. The article covers various retry patterns including immediate retry, delayed retry, and scheduled retry with different strategies for each.

Advanced retry patterns include implementing retry with jitter to prevent thundering herd problems, dead letter queue management for failed retries, retry budget implementation to limit resource consumption, and correlation-aware retry for related transactions. The guide addresses monitoring retry effectiveness, analyzing retry patterns to identify systemic issues, implementing retry policies based on business rules, and strategies for retry in distributed transactions. Best practices cover testing retry logic under various failure scenarios, documenting retry policies, and avoiding common pitfalls like infinite retry loops.

## Security

#### IP White/Black Listing
**Summary:** Implement IP-based access control for securing BusinessWorks services and applications.  
**Tags:** `BW5X`, `BW6X`, `BWCE`, `security`, `IP-filtering`, `access-control`

**Description:**  
This security guide provides comprehensive strategies for implementing IP-based access control in BusinessWorks applications, essential for protecting services from unauthorized access. You'll learn how to configure IP whitelisting and blacklisting at different levels (network, application, service), implement dynamic IP filtering based on threat intelligence, manage IP lists efficiently, and handle IP spoofing attempts. The article covers both IPv4 and IPv6 filtering, CIDR notation support, and integration with enterprise security infrastructure.

Advanced security topics include implementing geo-blocking based on IP location, rate limiting per IP address, managing IP reputation scores, and handling requests from behind proxies and load balancers. The guide addresses compliance requirements for IP filtering, audit logging of blocked requests, implementing temporary IP bans for suspicious activity, and strategies for managing IP lists at scale. Best practices cover testing IP filtering rules, maintaining IP list documentation, implementing fail-safe mechanisms, and balancing security with legitimate user access.

#### Implement Mutual Authentication (Two-Way SSL)
**Summary:** Configure mutual TLS authentication for secure bidirectional certificate validation.  
**Tags:** `BW6X`, `BWCE`, `mutual-auth`, `two-way-SSL`, `certificates`

**Description:**  
This advanced security guide provides detailed instructions for implementing mutual authentication (two-way SSL/TLS) in BusinessWorks applications, ensuring both client and server authenticate each other using certificates. You'll learn how to configure trust stores and key stores, manage certificate chains, implement certificate validation logic, and handle certificate renewal without downtime. The article covers both inbound and outbound mutual authentication scenarios with practical examples.

Critical security topics include managing certificate lifecycle, implementing certificate pinning for additional security, handling certificate revocation lists (CRL) and OCSP, and troubleshooting common mutual authentication failures. The guide addresses compliance requirements, certificate management at scale, implementing different authentication strengths for different clients, and strategies for migrating from one-way to mutual authentication. Best practices cover certificate security, key management, audit logging of authentication events, and disaster recovery procedures for certificate compromise scenarios.
