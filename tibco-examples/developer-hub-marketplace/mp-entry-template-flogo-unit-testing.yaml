  description: Unit testing is a technique where individual components or flows of
    an application are tested in isolation. With unit testing, you can monitor
    the health of your application and detect errors in individual flows or
    activity levels. While designing an application with multiple flows and
    activities, it becomes cumbersome to detect runtime errors at the flow and
    activity levels. Using unit testing the errors at micro level are easily
    handled.
